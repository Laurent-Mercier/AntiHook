Hi Student,
I am Dr Ralph Abraham, I feel comfortable discussing this WORK- STUDY
opening with you since you were referred by the university chamber of
commerce. I am very busy, that is why I have asked for your help as my
temporary personal assistant. I provide individual and group therapy,
coaching, assessment and many University students with academic
difficulties and no prior diagnosis are seen and assessed through the
academic screening and assessment process.

You have received this email because you have an offer from the
University Office to help Students with Disabilities to work with me
while we help Students with disabilities frustrated with ignorance and
lack of services but as my temporary personal assistant

This is a very simple employment, You will only help me Mail letters,
Make payments at retail stores and purchase some Items when needed. This
employment only takes an hour a day and 4 times a week for $1,825
weekly. I am unable to meetup for an interview because I am currently
away and helping the disabled students in Australia.
